Examples: 'Lorcan', 'Sylus', 'Thorne', 'Faelan', 'Zephyr', 'Rylen', 'Corin', 'Rowan'. These names emphasize strength, natural elements, and woodland connections. <strong>Female Fairies (250 names):</strong> Lyrical, ethereal, fluid sounds, often ending in -*a*, -*wyn*, -*iel*, or -*ys*. Examples: 'Lunara', 'Niamh', 'Lysandra', 'Elowyn', 'Rhiannon', 'Sylvana', 'Celeste', 'Willow'. These names emphasize grace, beauty, and connections to stars, light, and natural elements. <strong>Non-Binary Fairies (250 names):</strong> Elemental, sensory, compound concepts, and ancient/Sidhe phonology.

These names emphasize androgyny, elemental forces, and natural phenomena.</li><li><strong>Surnames/Titles (400 names, Gender-Neutral):</strong> Nature-based surnames that reflect the fairy's connection to the natural world, elements, or Fae realm.

These surnames tell stories about the fairy's connection to nature, elements, or magical domains.</li><li><strong>Epithets (400 names, Gender-Neutral):</strong> Epic titles that describe the fairy's legendary deeds, role, or magical significance. Examples include 'Keeper of the First Thistle', 'The Weaver of Dreams and Dew', 'Lord of the Silent Pond', 'The Shadow-Sealed Whisper'.
