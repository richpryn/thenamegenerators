From the lyrical 'Lunara' to the epic 'Lorcan Moonwhisper, Keeper of the First Thistle', fairy names tell stories of magical beings who dance in moonlit glades and guard ancient secrets. Our **Fairy Name Generator** creates authentic fairy names using three distinct formats: First Names Only (Lorcan, Lunara, Leafsong), Full Names (Lorcan Moonwhisper, Lunara Starfall), and Full Names with Epithets (Lorcan Moonwhisper, Keeper of the First Thistle), with gender filters for Male, Female, and Non-Binary fairies, drawing from Celtic, Nordic, and naturalistic folklore traditions to create names that resonate with enchantment and otherworldly beauty.",
