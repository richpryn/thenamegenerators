              <h3 class="faq-question">How does the similarity avoidance work?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">The generator prevents similar business names from appearing in the same batch by checking if words start with the same 3-4 characters. This ensures that words like 'Apex' and 'Acme' or 'Phoenix' and 'Phoebe' don't appear together, providing variety and preventing confusion.</p>

              <h3 class="faq-question">How do I choose the right category?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">Choose based on your brand values and market position: Aspirational & Upward for achievement-focused brands, Nature & Elements for natural/organic brands, Powerful & Dynamic for energy/force brands, Mythological & Legendary for transformative brands, Abstract & Conceptual for innovative brands, Modern & Tech-Inspired for technology brands, Animals & Creatures for strength/wisdom brands, Celestial & Cosmic for vastness/wonder brands, Movement & Flow for dynamic/progressive brands, or Materials & Textures for quality/luxury brands.</p>
