              <h3 class="faq-question">How does the name combination work?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">The generator combines first names and last names from separate pools, ensuring variety and preventing repetition. Each gender has its own pool of first names, while all High Elves share the same pool of surnames. This creates authentic combinations like 'Aelion Starweaver' or 'Galadriel Moonwhisper'.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use these names for other elf types?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">While these names are designed for High Elves, they can work for other sophisticated elven characters. However, Wood Elves typically use more nature-based names, and Dark Elves use sharper, more exotic names. For the most authentic experience, use the appropriate generator for each elf type.</p>
