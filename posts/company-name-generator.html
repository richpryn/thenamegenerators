  "articleBody": "Generate modern, brandable company names perfect for startups, businesses, and brands. Choose from single words, portmanteaus, trendy suffixes, invented words, or memorable combinations. Company names are the foundation of your brand identity. A great company name is short, memorable, easy to spell and pronounce, and works as a .com domain. Our **company name generator** offers 1,500+ brandable names across 5 distinct styles, helping you find the perfect name for your startup, business, or brand. Company Name Styles Each style offers different advantages for brand naming:    Single Word Brandable:  Strong, memorable single words perfect for company branding (Apex, Nexus, Phoenix, Atlas). These names are simple, iconic, and work across all industries.   Portmanteau & Invented:  Clever combinations of words (Amplify, Buildify, Evolva) that create unique, brandable names. Similar to successful brands like Spotify, Instagram, and Pinterest.   Trendy Suffix Words:  Modern naming with -ify, -ly, -io, -hub, -space, -lab, -tech, -works suffixes. These names feel contemporary and tech-forward.   Made-Up / Invented Words:  Pronounceable invented words with no specific meaning (Abryx, Corix, Dextra, Helix). These names are unique, brandable, and work globally.   Short Memorable Combinations:  Punchy 2-word combinations that work as company names (Blue Shift, North Star, True North). These names are descriptive yet flexible. What Makes a Great Company Name? A great company name should be:    Short & Memorable:  1-3 syllables ideal for easy recall   Easy to Spell & Pronounce:  People should be able to say and type it without confusion   Doesn't Describe the Business:  Allows for pivoting and expansion   Works as a .com Domain:  Check availability before committing   Unique and Brandable:  Stands out in the competitive market   Sounds Professional Yet Modern:  Appeals to your target audience   Examples of great company names include Apple, Stripe, Notion, Figma, Canva, Slack, and Zoom. These names are simple, memorable, and don't lock the company into one industry.
